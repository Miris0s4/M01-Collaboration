#variables store data
#python is weakly typed - you do not have to declare a data (int,float, etc...)type 

#int - whole number
#float - decimal
#strings - text
#boolean - T/F

x = 6 #int
y = 6.5 #float
name = "miriana" #string
mybool = True #bool true
falsebool = False #bool false

#functions - perform actions, take input, process the input, and produce an output
# functions are the verbs of the programming world - they perform actions and processing
#we will use built in python functions at first. you can denote a function by having a ()
#arguments are the data that goes in the (). they are used as part of the functions processes to calculate or use

#input function - take an input and return it intoa variable 
#the argument we stick inside the () in an input function is the prompt or text the user sees when asking for input
myname = input("what is your name")
#print function - displays something on screen. the argument you want to display 
print
