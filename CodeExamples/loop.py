#Also control structures. They repeat code until a condition is met.
#They use yhe same logic and relational opertators as if statements

#loops main goal is to repeat code until you do not want this code repeated 
#two types of loops - while and for

#while loop - is a loop that repeats code untila specific condition is met (usually using a flag or a sentinel value)
#and then is broken when that condition is met

#for loop - does a similar thing, but is a count controlled loop. It is controlled by a counter and repeats a certain 
#number of times and then exits

#while loop are usually broken bt a flag value that is changed inside the body of the loop when you need the loop
#broken

#flag / sentinel value 
keep_going = "y"
